# MinimalAPITodoApp

## This is the backend for the Todo application. The objectives for this project is to:
- Implement and learn minimal API.
  - Have a clear structure with the Separation Of Concerns principle in mind (21 lines of code for program.cs)
 
  
  - Customize the API and minimize boilerplate code - Be efficient and precise
  - The API endpoints should still be RESTful and handle errors with try-catch blocks

- Implement and learn Dapper Micro ORM 
  - Dapper is a powerful micro ORM that satisfies our needs with ease
  - Learn and implement stored procedures and generic data handling
    - This approach gives us flexibility to change many parts of the application without difficulty
    - It is also very powerful to handle data in a separate module
